# APIsites

These are three simple pages that demonstrate the use of Fetching from API's 
"3" uses the pokemon api to retrieve information about a pokemon
"BoredApi" gives suggestions of things to do along with a (fairly innacurate) pricing guide
"AnimalDraw" uses two different API's to prompt the user with an animal and a description to draw
